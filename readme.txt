Very simple calculator using Vanilla JS, html and css
To see the result you just need to extract it, and load the html file
I tried to do it as simple as possible
Also used Vanilla JS for the logic part.
I also tried to simplify the logic and tried to make the code readable and understandable

Anyway I would be happy to receive any feedback)
